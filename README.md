# factoriomousecontrol

This script lets you control the character of factorio with your mouse.
If the the right mouse button is clicked, the character will run towards the mouse (limited to 8 directions due to factorio) unless the mouse is in the center of screen deadzone (currently 20%, variable in the script). Clicking again, or pressing any button on the keyboard, will stop movement. 


## Installation
- Install autohotkey (www.autohotkey.com v1)
- Run factorio.ahk
- Have Fun
